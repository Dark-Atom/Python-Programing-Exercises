# Python-Programing-Exercises

## Introduction


* The exercise text and Solutions contents of this repository was collected from GitHub account of dark-atom. I collected it to  practice and solve all the listed problems with python 3. Even after these collected problems are all set up, I will try to add more problems in near future. If you want to work with python then I hope this exercise and solutions will help you a lot to get your hands free with python.

* it also contents the one liner solutions which is one liner solution for any question(if it possible for that question).

* I would gladly accept pointers from others to improve, simplify, or make the code more efficient.
